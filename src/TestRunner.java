Early humans lived in close-knit groups, relying on cooperation, communication, and rudimentary tools to hunt, gather, and protect themselves. Life was deeply intertwined with the environment, and survival depended on understanding the rhythms of natureâ€”seasons, migrations, and weather. Over time, humans began to develop language, culture, and spirituality, forming the earliest expressions of art, community, and belief. These foundational traits laid the groundwork for agriculture, settlement, and the birth of civilization, marking the slow but profound transformation from nomadic life to structured societies.";
